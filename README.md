# Scheduling Plugin for [DocPad](http://docpad.org)
Schedules content with a date in the future so that it is not published until that date.

## Install

Using Docpad's plugin installer:

```
docpad install scheduling
```

Or, the traditional way:

```
npm install --save docpad-plugin-scheduling
```


## Usage

Once installed the default is that scheduling is enabled for all documents with a ```date``` in the future. You can override this in your document's meta by setting.

```
---
date: '01 Jan 2259 00:00'
scheduled: false
---
```

This document will be rendered out even though it's date is in the future.

If your ```defaultScheduling``` configuration setting is ```false``` below, you can use the same meta keyword to specify that a particular file should be scheduled, i.e.

```
---
date: '01 Jan 2259 00:00'
scheduled: true
---
```

The document will not be rendered until after midnight on the 1st January 2259.

### Expiration of documents (optional)

If for whatever reason you want to 'expire' posts as well (perhaps your New Year's wishes if you expect to not be around to provide an update in the month that follows), you can use the (optional) ```expire``` field in your documents. The document will then automatically be expired.

```
---
date: '01 Jan 2016 00:00'
expire: '01 Feb 2016 00:00'
scheduled: true
---
```



## Configuration

There are two main configuration options

```
plugins:
	scheduling:
		# Schedule all documents with a date in the future by default, default: true.
		defaultScheduling: true

		# Schedule files in development environment, default: true.
		devScheduling: true
```

### Automatic scheduling on your deployed server

This plugin is probably of most use when used in combination with DocPad's ```regenerateEvery``` setting, allowing you to schedule your content and have it published automatically on the next regeneration after the document's date.
